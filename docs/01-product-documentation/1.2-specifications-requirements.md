# üìÑ 1.2 - Product Specifications & Requirements

---

## üß† Business Problem

Users across social media platforms frequently save posts for later ‚Äî but rarely return to them. Saved content gets buried, forgotten, or becomes inaccessible. There is no unified system that helps users resurface saved content at the right time with context.

---

## üéØ Goals & Objectives

- Provide users with a central mobile hub to save and manage valuable content
- Eliminate friction in saving content via OS-native sharing workflows
- Automatically categorize content using AI for fast retrieval
- Send reminders to revisit saved content at preferred times
- Offer a smooth, mobile-first UX with zero browser extensions or logins

   - **B.** Selects PostStash from favorites in the share menu
   - **C.** Chooses PostStash as a suggested app (if enabled)
4. AI fetches metadata:
   - Title, thumbnail, and description
5. Content is categorized using AI
   - Category tile‚Äôs visual indicator is updated

## üßæ Assumptions & Constraints

- Users are familiar with how to copy and share links on their mobile device.
- Mobile app is the primary interface; no web dashboard is planned in MVP.
- Users will manually initiate content saving (no auto-sync with social platforms).
- AI categorization will rely on metadata from the shared link (e.g. title, description).
- Android is prioritized for initial builds due to testing and deployment tooling.
- Notification delivery depends on user permissions and FCM availability.

---

## üö´ Out of Scope (MVP)

- Auto-syncing saved content from social media platforms.
- Web version of PostStash.
- Manual category selection during onboarding (handled by AI).
- Social features (likes, shares, comments).
- In-app analytics dashboard or reporting.
- Offline access to full content (only metadata/title/preview available offline).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

| Category          | Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Performance**   | App responds to user actions within 1.5 seconds. |
| **Security**      | All data transmission must use HTTPS; auth via Firebase must be secure. |
| **Scalability**   | Backend designed to support up to 10,000 active users for MVP. |
| **Availability**  | 99.5% uptime expected for backend services. |
| **Usability**     | Onboarding flow must be completed in < 3 minutes on average. |
| **Privacy**       | App must comply with GDPR standards for personal data handling. |

---

## üîó Dependencies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users do not complete onboarding or share menu setup | Make onboarding visually engaging, add skip + retry options, and show reminders in-app |
| AI miscategorizes content | Allow users to manually edit categories post-save in future release |
| Link metadata fails to fetch | Implement fallback UI and consider using a 3rd-party parser |
| Delays in FCM delivery or opt-outs | Let users choose multiple time slots and show silent in-app reminders |
| App build breaks due to config errors (e.g. `google-services.json`) | Use EAS secrets + automate build validation in CI |
| Reliance on 3rd-party AI APIs | Consider local fallback models or caching if OpenAI service degrades |
| GDPR/Privacy non-compliance | Store only necessary data, offer delete account option, and document retention policy |
| AI model underperforms due to limited training data | Continuously improve by analyzing tagging patterns and user corrections in future updates |
