## 🧠 Business Problem

Users across social media platforms frequently save posts for later — but rarely return to them. Saved content gets buried, forgotten, or becomes inaccessible. There is no unified system that helps users resurface saved content at the right time with context.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

- Provide users with a central mobile hub to save and manage valuable content
- Eliminate friction in saving content via OS-native sharing workflows
- Automatically categorize content using AI for fast retrieval
- Send reminders to revisit saved content at preferred times
- Offer a smooth, mobile-first UX with zero browser extensions or logins
